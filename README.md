- Hi, I’m Zara Burton
- :gear: I’m an Engineer specialising in the design and prototyping of automated systems - mechanical and control
- My current thoughts focus a lot around best practices:
    1. :link: I'm currently learning the best practice for programming industrial control systems
    2. :chains: I'm currently pondering potential best practices for agile development of hardware 
- Further interests and experience include (/ a list of things I would really enjoy discussing, debating or learning more about):
   - :four_leaf_clover: Multi-disiplinary design & optimisation
   - :recycle: Life Cycle Analysis 
   - :brain: Autonomous control system design
   - :jigsaw: Disassembly- design for, automation (with a particular interest in unscrewing), modelling and optimisation
   - :battery: The problem, and possible solutions, to electronic waste 
   - :woman_technologist: Neat applications of probabalistics
   - :leaves:  Bio-inspired anything
